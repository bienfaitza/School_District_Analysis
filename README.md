In this Rework the requirement is to correct some errors
happened on THOMAS HIGH SCHOOL data regarding math score and reading score

The school board requires to replace the 9th grade reading and math score with NaN values
because the data were recorded by mistake.

analysis after cleaning data in order to produce new report.
